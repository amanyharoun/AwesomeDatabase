## Design executive summary:

### Merging two Projects
This project is a merge between two projects: The course project: https://codepen.io/amany_h/pen/KKVGoJE and the Firebase project: https://codepen.io/amany_h/pen/VweozbG
The puporse of merging both projects is to create an interface that includes details for employees to enter the data and pass them onto the Firebase Database and also to include some of the 
#### conditional rendering code in the first project was changed in the final one to include employee benefits instead.
      
      
 #### List Rendering: Mapping an Array
      Also list rendering was also used to map arrays with elements with v-for to provide details for entering the data.
      
## Firebase
A collection of books was created on Firebase and on Codepen, two properties were created for the user to enter the properties Name and Genre.
To make sure data entry is passed from Codepen to Firebase event and datahandling using @click, mounted hook and methods were used.
